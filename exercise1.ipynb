1. Print the edges and vertices of the graph in set representation. (`25 points`)
# put your answer here
# ADDING vertex
add_vertex("A")
add_vertex("B")
add_vertex("C")
add_vertex("D")
add_vertex("E")

add_edge("A","C","A")
add_edge("B","A","B")
add_edge("C","B","C")
add_edge("C","D","C")
add_edge("E","A","E")

2. Implement the weighted graph in python code. Use the print_graph() function. (`25 points`)
# put your answer here
print_graph()
3. You decided to go on a trip around the philippines. Being a computer scientist, you wanted to find the optimal route that would cost the least amount of money to travel all four cities. Find the route and print the total cost of the most optimal route. (`50 points`)
